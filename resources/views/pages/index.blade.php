                                    Cryptocurrencies flip the entire system on its head. They allow users to make anonymous transactions, where they are unable to be tracked or identified by financial institutions, third parties, or government actors. Cryptocurrencies have become infamous for financial speculation.

                                    Cryptocurrency use is exploding all over the world. It is seeing rapid growth for a number of reasons, but the biggest is that it provides a level of privacy that canâ€™t be matched. Current financial transactions track a wide range of data about you. This data can be viewed by financial institutions.
